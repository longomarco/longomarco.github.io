								<h2>Allow me to introduce myself</h2>
								<p align="justify">A few words about me: I'm Marco, and I live in Italy. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in finance and business management, respectively. So why a data analysis portfolio, then?<br>
									Well, right after I graduated, I began to look around me, considering my knowledge and skills in comparison to those required by the market.
									Learning Python brought me into the world of data analysis. I was well aware of the importance of statistics in representing reality and making predictions, but discovering the tools' ability to shape data into clear and effective information immediately excited me.
									Working with datasets was like solving an enigma: it's intriguing to look for patterns among different phenomena, much as I find interesting the new possibilities that machine learning may offer in the field of predictive analysis, and the idea of communicating knowledge through data storytelling is something I find engaging.
									That's when I realized this was what I wanted to pursue with my life.<br> <br> <i>Looking for answers through data.</i></p>

								<h2>What I have learned until now</h2>
								<p align='justify'>I have learned that at the heart of every successful result, there is always a proven process: even a good analysis can be broken down into several steps that must be followed so that it can be as effective and clear as possible.<br>
									 Those that I consider to be the most important are listed below.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-database">
									<h3>Data Extraction</h3>
									<p align='justify'>We need to understand what data sets we have and what they represent. <br>
										We may have to pull data from different sources, 
										understand how different datasets are structured.<br> A good query can save a lot of time.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-snowplow">
									<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
									<p align='justify'>It can happen that data extracted from any source needs to be "cleaned".
										 Outliers and duplicate data can distort an analysis, as can missing or inconsistent values: 
										 how you decide to handle them can make a huge difference.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-brain">
									<h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
									<p align='justify'>More information can be extracted from the available data, for example by identifying patterns or clusters. 
										In this, great help can be offered by machine learning algorithms.
										The more information we can obtain, the richer the analysis can be.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-area-chart">
									<h3>Analysis</h3>
									<p align='justify'>Now we can use a wide range of tools (from a good spreadsheet to a python library) 
										to aggregate all available data. <br> Through tables and graphs we can build a picture 
										of the reality that the data represent.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-search-plus">
									<h3>Gaining Insights</h3>
									<p align='justify'>Through critical and analytical thinking we can now use our analysis to answer various questions such as:<br>
										<i>Why are our sales dropping in November, which departments are performing better, which stocks in our warehouse is depleting faster...</i></p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-comment-dots">
									<h3>Storytelling</h3>
									<p align='justify'>It is not just a matter of finding answers, but also knowing how to communicate them. 
										The ultimate goal of analytics is to share the results with stakeholders.<br>
									After all, knowledge is only real when it is shared. </p>

							<h2>Technical Knowledge</h2>
							<p align='justify'>I think the toolbox, for anyone who wants to work with data, should be as rich as possible, in order to best handle different needs. 
								I love learning new things and I plan to enrich my knowledge with new languages and new tools.<br>
